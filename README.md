# Title

XR-Based Interactive Navigation System

## Background

Today, navigation system has become an indispensable tool in people's daily life. However, we have identified several issues with common navigation methods such as mobile navigation and in-car navigation:

1. The guidance provided by voice navigation is not clear enough.
2. Difficulties in integrating the mobile screen with the actual road conditions lead to safety concerns.

To address these, leveraging extended reality (XR) technology, we have designed an intelligent interactive navigation system with the aim of overcoming the shortcomings of current navigation methods.
